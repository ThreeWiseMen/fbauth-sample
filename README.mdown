FBAuth Sample Site
==================

This is a sample Facebook application designed to illustrate integration of the FBAuth plugin for Rails.

Integration of FBAuth into a normal Rails app is fairly straightforward:

- add "gem 'fbauth'" to your environment.rb
- set up config/facebook.yml
- make an auth_controller for your app with a 3-part authentication page
- add "include FacebookAuthFunctions" and "before_filter :require_facebook_auth" to your controllers requiring authentication
